The primary family unit is the extended family, but there's a rising trend towards nuclear families due to socio-economic factors.[578][579] Both men and women typically wear Shalwar Kameez; men also favor trousers, jeans, and shirts.[580] The middle class has grown to about 35 million, with another 17 million in the upper and upper-middle classes, leading to a shift in power from rural landowners to urban elites.[581] Festivals like Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Azha, Ramadan, Christmas, Easter, Holi, and Diwali are primarily religious.[578] Pakistan ranks 56th on the A.T. Kearney/FP Globalization Index due to increasing globalization.[582]",

It also aims to provide global mobile broadband.[6] Starlink has been instrumental to SpaceX's growth.[7]\n\nSpaceX started launching Starlink satellites in 2019. As of September 2024, the constellation consists of over 7,000 mass-produced small satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO)[8] that communicate with designated ground transceivers. Nearly 12,000 satellites are planned to be deployed, with a possible later extension to 34,400. SpaceX announced reaching more than 1 million subscribers in December 2022[9] and 4 million subscribers in September 2024.[10]\n\nThe SpaceX satellite development facility in Redmond, Washington, houses the Starlink research, development, manufacturing, and orbit control facilities. In May 2018, SpaceX estimated the total cost of designing, building and deploying the constellation would be at least US$10 billion.[1] Revenues from Starlink in 2022 were reportedly $1.4 billion accompanied by a net loss, with a small profit being reported that began only in 2023.[11] In May 2024 revenue was expected to reach $6.6 billion in 2024[12] but later in that year the prediction was raised to $7.7 billion.[13] Revenue is expected to reach $11.8 billion in 2025.[13]",
